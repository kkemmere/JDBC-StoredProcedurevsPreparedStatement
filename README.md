# JDBC-StoredProcedurevsPreparedStatement
JDBC program that displays a query from a prepared statment &amp; stored procedure written in Java, MySQL<br/>

Program connects to database and uses a prepared statement to query employee ID, Name and Location. Prepared statement query data is then output before the stored procedure is called. Prepared statement and stored procedure in this instance are the same. This is just showcasing two different implementations in JDBC.<br/>

All data in the database is fake and used for testing only.<br/>
